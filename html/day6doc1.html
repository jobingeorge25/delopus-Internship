    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>
        Javascript can be used to make our pages more dynamic. We can declare functions that take place based on a
        certain action fom the user. Javascript can be included in our html files by using the script tag. Incase a page
        does not support the script tag we can use the 'noscript' tag to show an appropriate message.
    </p>
    <h2>Head Element</h2>
    <p>
        The head element contains data about data (meta data). These are not displayed on the webpage but do have an
        effect on the content and the page. We shall dicuss the various tags used in the head section.<br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            title - defines the title of the document to be displayed on the title bar
        </li>
        <li>
            style - contains css code to make necessary changes to that page
        </li>
        <li>
            meta - used to specify character set, viewport details etc
        </li>
        <!--character set specifies the character encoding used in the document-->
        <!--viewport stands for the part of the screen the user sees-->
        <li>
            script - to include client side Javascripts
        </li>
        <li>
            base - mentions the base url of the document
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Layout</h2>
    <p>Layouts give our document a structure .We can use semantic elements and CSS to organise our webpae. Semantic
        elements are those that have a particular meaning, for example a header element classifies the content inside as
        a header that can be used as an introduction to our page. CSS can be used to create grids,float,flexbot etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
    <p>
        Making a page responsive is to make a page adjust its elements depending on the kind of device the user uses to
        give a comfortable experience. Certain techniques include giving meta information, using vw(viewport width),
        setting percentage values for width of an image, using 'picture' element to provide different formats or even
        different images. Using media queries help to adjust elements on resizing the page.
    </p>
    <h2>Computer Code</h2>
    <p>
        We can use certain elements to define particular content
        <ul>
            <li>kbd - keyboard input</li>
            <li>samp - sample output</li>
            <li>code - code snippet</li>
            <li>var - variable</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
