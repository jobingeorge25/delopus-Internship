    <h2>Style Guide</h2>
    <p>There are some practices that can be followed to make our code clean
    <ul>
        <li>using lowercase attribute names</li>
        <li>closing html elements</li>
        <li>declaring doctype</li>
        <li>quote attribute values</li>
        <li>improve readability by indenting and adding blank lines when necessary</li>
        <li>include lang, viewport settings, and charset</li>
        <li>use stylesheets to improve presentation</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>HTML entities or escape characters are used to display reserved characters. For example the less than and greater
        than symbols are used to open and close tags in HTML and therefore have a special meaning assigned if we type
        this symbol as regular text it will not be recognized as such. Therefore we have entities of the format
        '&entity;'. Each such speacial character has both an entity name and an entity number.</p>

    <h2>XHTML</h2>
    <p>The e<ins>X</ins>tensible <ins>H</ins>yper<ins>T</ins>ext <ins>M</ins>arkup <ins>L</ins>anguage is an XML based
        version of HTML. It follows a stricter syntax than HTML. There are certain ways of coding that are accepted by
        HTML but not XHTML. For example unqouted lowercase attribute names are mandatory in XHTML but not in HTML.</p>
